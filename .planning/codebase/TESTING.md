# Testing Patterns

**Analysis Date:** 2026-02-16

## Test Framework

**Runner:**
- No dedicated test runner configuration (e.g., `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`) was found in the codebase.

**Assertion Library:**
- Not detected, as no testing framework is explicitly configured.

**Run Commands:**
```bash
# No explicit test commands found or configured.
# Likely, tests are not automated or rely on manual verification.
```

## Test File Organization

**Location:**
- No test files following common naming conventions (`*.test.*` or `*.spec.*`) were found in the codebase. This suggests tests are not co-located with source files using these patterns, or a different convention is used.

**Naming:**
- Not applicable, as no test files were detected.

**Structure:**
```
# No test file structure detected.
```

## Test Structure

**Suite Organization:**
```typescript
// No test suites detected.
```

**Patterns:**
- No explicit setup, teardown, or assertion patterns were observed due to the absence of test files.

## Mocking

**Framework:**
- Not detected.

**Patterns:**
```typescript
// No mocking patterns detected.
```

**What to Mock:**
- Not applicable.

**What NOT to Mock:**
- Not applicable.

## Fixtures and Factories

**Test Data:**
```typescript
// No test data fixtures or factories detected.
```

**Location:**
- Not applicable.

## Coverage

**Requirements:**
- No test coverage requirements or configuration were found.

**View Coverage:**
```bash
# No commands for viewing test coverage detected.
```

## Test Types

**Unit Tests:**
- No explicit unit tests were found following common patterns.

**Integration Tests:**
- No explicit integration tests were found following common patterns.

**E2E Tests:**
- No E2E testing framework or tests were detected.

## Common Patterns

**Async Testing:**
```typescript
// No asynchronous testing patterns detected.
```

**Error Testing:**
```typescript
// No error testing patterns detected.
```
